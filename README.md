# Driving detection and warning system based on deep learning
<br>
<br>
Road traffic accidents cause huge losses to people's lives and property every year. According to the accident survey, 86% of traffic accidents are caused by improper driving behavior of drivers.<br><br>
The driving behavior recognition early warning control system is based on deep learning and vehicle networking technology. The driver's facial expression, driving attitude and voice information are collected through the sensing device, and these samples are uploaded to the cloud by means of the vehicle network system supported by 5G technology, using deep learning technology. Evaluate whether the driver currently has potentially dangerous driving behavior, and give appropriate prompts or take enforcement measures to effectively reduce traffic accidents caused by the driver's own reasons. At the same time, combined with cloud computing technology to further reduce artificial intelligence restrictions on hardware devices. .<br><br>
When a risk driving behavior is identified, the system will immediately alert the driver to correct driving behavior and avoid traffic accidents. In order to further reduce hardware requirements and achieve more and more intelligent identification systems, a cloud service system is built to transmit driving data in real time to the cloud for intensive learning to resolve the contradiction between the individualization and universality of dangerous driving behavior.

2.The system is not three modules: face state detection module, limb motion recognition module, speech emotion analysis module
<br><br>
3.【Current progress】：The limb part has been basically completed, the facial part is temporarily not integrated, and the speech part only has the stage of voice-to-text<br><br>
